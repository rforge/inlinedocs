Dear editor, thank you for the reviews of our article on
inlinedocs. We have taken them into consideration and resubmit a new
version of the article.

We address the specific concerns of the reviewers below:

Reviewer 1 wanted to see a PDF version of the generated documentation,
and so we added a 2-page section to the appendix that shows the PDF
generated for the apply function.

Reviewer 2 asked about a specific plan to incorporate documentation
generation into the R CMD build process. We changed section 2.5 to
emphasize that package.skeleton.dx() must be run before R CMD
build. However, we feel that any further commentary about integration
into the R toolchain is too speculative for inclusion in the article.

Reviewer 2 suggested a ##file<< tag to have inlinedocs support
documentation of multiple objects per Rd file. By design, this is not
supported, and so we changed section 2.5 to clarify this.

Reviewer 2 is "not sure about registering exclusions: ideally,
inlinedocs would simply leave the Rd files alone that it will not
overwrite." By design, inlinedocs writes an Rd file for every object
in the package, so no files are left alone unless you specifically
indicate that. We clarified this by adding to section 2.5.

We added a sentence to clarify what the ##end<< tag in section 2.3
does.

We clarified section 2.4 by stating that we detect S3 methods using
functions from the utils package.

Reviewer 2's helpful minor comments about the old R reference, "S4
generic methods," the "Sweave format," the inconsistent use of .Rd and
Rd in section 4, and the strange appearance of $apply$keyword in
section A.2 have been addressed in the text.
