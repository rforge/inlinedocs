Converting inline comments to Rd
Toby Dylan Hocking
29 July 2009

To use inlinedocs you must adhere to the following conventions:

We will call your package to submit to CRAN "pkg" and it will be in a
directory of the same name. Thus your R code should live in
pkg/R/file.R and the package documentation will go in
pkg/man/fun.name.Rd

Start up R in the pkg/R directory, then:
> library(inlinedocs)
> package.skeleton.dx()

This should set everything up for you in the pkg/man directory so that
your package passes R CMD check.

However, you will need to document your data sets yourself (try using
the prompt function).
