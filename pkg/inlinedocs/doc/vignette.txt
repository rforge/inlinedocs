Converting inline comments to Rd
Toby Dylan Hocking
29 July 2009

To use inlinedocs you must adhere to the following conventions:

We will call your package to submit to CRAN "pkg" and it will be in a
directory of the same name. Thus your R code should live in
pkg/R/file.R and the package documentation will go in
pkg/man/fun.name.Rd

Start up R in the pkg/R directory, then source
