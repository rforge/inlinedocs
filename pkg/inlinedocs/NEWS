== Version 1.3
  
* examples.after.return is modified to detect where examples start using a
  specific mark (either ##examples<<, or #{{{examples). This way, it does not
  get trap with multiple return() in the function, or the presence of a
  return() in the examples

* examples.in.attr parser is added. It look at an "ex" attribute containing
  code of the examples, either as a character string, or as a function.
  
* Added dependence to 'utils' package (for things like package.skeleton())

* Added the possibility to build a NAMESPACE (argument namespace in
  package.skeleton.dx()). A NAMESPACE is also added to the inlinedocs package.
  
* When DESCRIPTION file is empty, fill required fields with reasonable values,
  e.g., Package: with the same name as dir, Version: 1.0-0, etc.
  
* Automatic detection of S3 methods added, and correct formatting of usage and
  addition of entries in NAMESPACE as required.
  
* Reformatting of special cases usages, like fun<-(x, value) => fun(x) <- value,
  met<-.obj(x, ..., value) => method{met}{obj}(x, ...) <= value, and
  %op%(e1, e2) <- e1 %op% e2
  
* Now the packages in the imports field are considered too, as well for building
  the NAMESPACE file
  
* If there is an 'encoding' field in DESCRIPTION, it is now taken into account
  (according to Writing R Extensions manual, it applies to to R code)!
  
* There is now the possbility to place external examples elsewhere that in /tests.
  Just indicate the subdirectory wher you place them in
  options(inlinedocs.exdir = "exsubsir")

* The names of .Rd files was not computed correctly when functions with names like
  `obj<-`, or `%op%`. Corrected.
  
* The presence of platform specific code in /R/unix or /R/windows is not supported
  by inlinedocs (currnetly). However, this was ignored silently. Now,
  package.skeleton.dx() stops process when it find one of these subdirs.
  
* A couple of error messages where badly formatted when they included several
  items like in stop("Need ",names(f)[f]," in ",descfile). Corrected.
  
* Wrong extraction of package names form 'Depends' field in case where packages
  contain one or more dots in their names. Corrected.

* It is necessary to eliminate 'R' from the list of packages to load from
  'Depends' field. Corrected.

* package.skeleton.dx() tried to load packages already laoded, and failed to
  unload packages (including their namespaces, if possible) that where not
  loaded before exiting. Corrected.
